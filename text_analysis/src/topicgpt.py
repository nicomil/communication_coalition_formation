"""
Adapter for TopicGPT (Pham et al., NAACL 2024).

The experimenter asked that the paper's code be used strictly: this module does
**not** rewrite the algorithm. It prepares the input in the format TopicGPT
expects, calls the package's official functions in the prescribed order, and
maps the output back onto the experiment's keys. Topic generation, refinement,
assignment and correction remain entirely the authors' code.

Official repository: https://github.com/chtmp223/topicGPT

Installation
------------
The PyPI package (0.2.7) imports vLLM at top level, a heavy dependency that
cannot be installed on macOS without a GPU; the ``main`` branch on GitHub has
already made it an optional extra. Install from the repository, which is needed
anyway because **the prompt files are not inside the package**: they live in
`prompt/` in the repository and are an integral part of the method.

    git clone https://github.com/chtmp223/topicGPT.git
    pip install ./topicGPT           # without the [vllm] extra

Unit of analysis
----------------
TopicGPT is run on **directed-pair documents**: everything participant i wrote
to participant j is one document. Each subject contributes up to two documents
and a complete triad contributes six. Topic induction and topic assignment use
the same directed documents.

Backend
-------
TopicGPT talks to OpenAI, Azure, Vertex, Gemini, Ollama or vLLM. The paper uses
OpenAI, which remains the most faithful choice. Two routes reach Claude without
modifying the authors' code: the ``vertex`` backend, which in the repository
builds an ``AnthropicVertex`` client, or the ``openai`` backend pointed at a
compatible gateway through ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``.
