* 05_validation_and_topics.do — the optional stages
*
* Both sections run only if the corresponding stage was run in the pipeline:
*   llm_*  columns come from `--llm`      (the validation rubric)
*   nlp_*_topics from `python run.py topics` (TopicGPT)
*
* If the columns are not there the section is skipped with a message, so this
* file can be run after any pipeline run without editing it.

* 1. Convergent validity: dictionaries against a language model
*==============================================================================
* The two roads are methodologically independent — one counts function words,
* the other reads the text — so their correlation is evidence about the
* measures, not a tautology. A weak correlation is a finding to report, not a
* fault to fix.
